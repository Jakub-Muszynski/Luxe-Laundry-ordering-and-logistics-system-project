# Luxe-Laundry-ordering-and-logistics-system-project
This project was created for Luxe Laundry to solve their problem with logistics and ordering system that would unsure proper checks are made at all points throughout the ordering and wash process.

problem Luxe Laudry is facing: When a customerr requests a wash order for x amout of linin. therre are currently a numberr of checks and confirmations that happen only sporadically. this can results in the following types of problems

1) Customer requests 40 towels to be washed but only suplies 37 towels, becuase the amout of towels supplied by cusomemer is not checked, we send 40 back as per the order at the cost of 3 towels on Luxe Laundry.
2) Reject linin is where it has been spolit to such an extend that it cannot be properly cleaned, therefore, this should be rejected by Luxe at an additional cost of the customer. These are not checked on arrival, revenue is lost where we cannot provide the origin of spolit linin.
